# LearnSchool

You know what,
Youtube is one of the best thing that ever happened.
Whatever i have learned and whatever i know, Youtube can be considered as one of the reason.

For education youtube is one of the best but there is one problem
and it is "Recommended Videos" or "Suggested Videos".
When i Open youtube to watch some educational videos (let's say a lecture)
in a min or two when i get bored i start to scroll down to see recommmended videos while the lecture is playing
and within some seconds, 
i get lost,
i forget why i was there even at first place,
and start to watch some entertaining videos.

May be i don't have self control.

but then i thought why don't i make a youtube video player which dont recommend any videos,
which just plays video which you are watching.

and while working on that project  i thought whenever i am watching educational videos most of it are playlists.
i i changed the idea and created a Youtube Playlist Player.

so here it is a Youtube Playlist Player.

it's kind of incomplete cause settings menu doesn't have any option.
but in my defence i didn't needed that.
so may be in future i will complete it.
Or.............
You can complete it :)

To run it on your machine you will also need to add a dotenv file in it's home directory with feilds such as

  React_App_Api_Key=''
  React_App_Channel_Id=''
  React_App_apiKey=""
  React_App_authDomain=""
  React_App_projectId=""
  React_App_storageBucket=""
  React_App_messagingSenderId=""
  React_App_appId=""
  React_App_measurementId=""
  
  
the first one is youtube API Key which you will can get from GCP (just search on youtube "how to get youtube api key")
and the other ones are firebase configuration which you can get but creating a project on firebase and also don't forget 
to enable google login cause this project needs google id to let you login.


i think that is all.

bye........;)
